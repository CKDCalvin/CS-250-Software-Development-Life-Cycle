#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
#Interpreting user needs requires understanding the end-users and the context in which they will use the software. This involves gathering requirements through interviews, surveys, or observations and then translating these needs into clear, actionable items. Creating “user stories” is a powerful way to accomplish this. User stories focus on the end-user's perspective, helping to break down complex requirements into manageable tasks that can be prioritized and implemented incrementally. They keep the development process user-centric, ensuring that the software delivers real value to its users.

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
#When developing programs, I start with a clear understanding of the problem domain and the end-users' needs. Agile processes, particularly Scrum and Test-Driven Development (TDD), are key to my approach. I plan to incorporate Scrum’s sprint cycles and regular reviews to ensure continuous progress and alignment with user needs. TDD will help me maintain a high code quality, as writing tests before the code itself ensures that my development is driven by clear objectives and that I’m consistently meeting those objectives.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
#Being a good team member in software development means being collaborative, communicative, and reliable. It involves actively contributing to the team’s goals while being open to feedback and willing to help others. It means being adaptable to changing requirements and ready to support the team in meeting challenges, ultimately ensuring the success of the project.
